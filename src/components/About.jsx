      <p className="about-intro">
        I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Electrical &
        Electronics Engineering, where I balance academics with a strong focus
        on software development. Over time, I have developed a keen interest in
        building scalable web applications and understanding how systems work
        end-to-end.
      </p>

      <p className="about-intro">
        Alongside full-stack development using the MERN stack, I actively work
        on improving my problem-solving abilities by practicing data structures
        and algorithms primarily in <strong>Java</strong>. I enjoy breaking down
        problems, analyzing edge cases, and writing efficient, readable
        solutions.
      </p>

      <p className="about-intro">
        My learning journey includes hands-on projects, structured coursework,
        and participation in technical events and hackathons. These experiences
        have helped me collaborate effectively, adapt quickly, and apply
        theoretical concepts to real-world challenges.
